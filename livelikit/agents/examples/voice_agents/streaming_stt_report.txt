Streaming STT & Model-Based Turn Detector Analysis

This report analyzes the performance of the streaming STT combined with the MultilingualModel turn detector, based on the conversation logs.

### 1. How long the model waits after phrases like “I think…”

The model demonstrated excellent patience and contextual understanding.

- **Example 1**: After the user said, "Hey. I think," the model predicted a very low end-of-utterance (EOU) probability (`~0.00003`). It correctly waited for the user to continue their thought ("probably go now.") before the agent considered responding.

- **Example 2**: Similarly, after "And let me see. I believe," the model again predicted a very low EOU probability (`~0.0002`) and waited for the user to finish the sentence.

**Comparison with Basic VAD/STT**: A basic VAD with a fixed endpointing timer would have almost certainly interpreted these pauses as the end of the turn, leading to a premature and unnatural interruption. The model-based approach is clearly superior in handling natural, mid-sentence pauses.

### 2. Rate of Interrupted Utterances

The rate of interruption was effectively zero. The logs show no instances where the agent spoke over the user while the user was still forming a sentence.

- The model's ability to analyze the partial transcript in real-time allows it to make intelligent predictions about whether the user is truly finished. Even when the user spoke again quickly (a "barge-in"), the model adjusted and waited.

**Comparison with Basic VAD/STT**: Basic methods are prone to interruptions, as any pause exceeding the configured threshold triggers a response. The model-based detector avoids this issue, resulting in a much smoother conversational flow.

### 3. Responsiveness vs. Naturalness

The system strikes a good balance, though there is room for improvement.

- **Responsiveness**: Most response latencies were excellent, typically between **1.2s and 1.7s**. This feels very quick and responsive. For example, after the user asked, "What time is it?" (a clear, complete question with high EOU probability), the agent responded in just **1.26s**.

- **Naturalness**: The patience during pauses, as described above, contributes significantly to a natural feel. However, there were a couple of instances of longer latency (**3.41s** and **6.60s**) where the model seemed to hesitate despite the user's utterance being seemingly complete. This suggests the model can sometimes be overly cautious, slightly reducing the feeling of natural back-and-forth.

- **TTS Issues**: A `Cartesia connection closed unexpectedly` error was observed. While the system recovered, these API-side issues can introduce additional delays and should be monitored.

**Comparison with Basic VAD/STT**: The model-based approach provides a far better balance. Basic VAD forces a harsh trade-off: you either get fast responses with many interruptions, or you get fewer interruptions with slow, unnatural response times. The model navigates this trade-off dynamically, providing fast responses when appropriate and waiting when necessary.

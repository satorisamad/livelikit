## 1. Parameter Tuning Outcomes

### 1.1 Turn Detection Optimization

#### MultilingualModel vs. Basic VAD/STT
**Objective:** Optimize conversation flow and reduce interruptions

| Method | Response Latency | False Triggers | Naturalness Score |
|--------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Basic VAD (500ms) | 1.0-1.5s | High | 2/5 |
| Basic VAD (1000ms) | 1.3-1.9s | Medium | 3/5 |
| MultilingualModel | 1.4-3.4s | Very Low | 5/5 |

**Key Findings:**
- **MultilingualModel** achieved excellent balance between responsiveness and naturalness
- Successfully handled natural pauses (e.g., "I think..." scenarios) with EOU probability ~0.0001
- Eliminated premature interruptions that plagued basic VAD methods
- **Recommendation:** MultilingualModel is superior for production use

#### Threshold Tuning Results
Progressive tuning of `unlikely_threshold` parameter:

| Threshold | Avg Latency | Edge Cases | User Experience |
|-----------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| 0.1 | 2.3-6.7s | Some timeouts | Good |
| 0.05 | 1.5-2.3s | Rare timeouts | Excellent |
| 0.001 | 22-26s | Ultra-natural | Very thoughtful |

**Final Configuration:**
```python
turn_detection=MultilingualModel(unlikely_threshold=0.05)
```

### 1.2 STT Parameter Optimization

**Objective:** Reduce transcript processing latency

| Configuration | Processing Time | Accuracy | Trade-offs |
|---------------|----------------|----------|------------|
| Batch STT | 100-300ms | High | Higher latency |

- 3-word threshold for partial prompting improved relevance
- Turn-end detection remained primary bottleneck

### 1.3 TTS Speed Optimization

#### Speaking Rate Tuning
**Objective:** Achieve natural, human-like speech delivery

| Speed Setting | User Feedback | Use Case |
|---------------|---------------|----------|
| 1.0 (Normal) | "Too fast" | Default |
| 0.8 | "Better but still fast" | Improved |
| 0.6 | "Much more natural" | **Optimal** |
| 0.4 | "Too slow" | Accessibility |

**Final Configuration:**
```python
